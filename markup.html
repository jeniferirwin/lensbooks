        <div class="tagdesc">
            This is any of your book's keywords. If you don't have this
            tag defined, the commands in the final copypaste box won't work right.

        <div class="tagdesc">
                Normally, the book generator will break input into pages such
                that each page is no more than 24 lines long. This is to help
                the book conform to the classic terminal size of 80 columns and
                24 rows. Placing a NOAUTOBREAK tag at the top of the document
                will prevent the generator from doing this. However, if you have very
                long pages, that might make the book feel a bit unwieldy on
                some configurations.

        <div class="tagdesc">
          The section name is what will go at the top of every page in the section.

        <div class="tagdesc">
          Use this to end a page earlier than autobreaking would.
          If you use NOAUTOBREAK but you also never use a PAGEBREAK,
          your book will exist as one giant page.
