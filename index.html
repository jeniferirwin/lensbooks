        Welcome to the Lensmoor Book Generator. If you're here by accident
        and you don't know what a 'Lensmoor' is, consider checking it
        out at <a href="https://grapevine.haus/games/Lensmoor/play">https://grapevine.haus/games/Lensmoor/play</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're here on purpose, welcome and I hope you find the generator helpful! Start
        typing your book in the left pane and you'll see the formatted version of it showing
        up in realtime on the right. Finally, in the box at the very bottom, you'll find all
        the commands required to create the book in-game. You must have the restring tokens
        and your book object in your inventory when you start running the commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also need to make sure that you don't paste all the commands into
        the MUD at once, or you WILL be disconnected. Some MUD clients have a feature that
        allows you to load in the lines of a text file with a short delay between each line.
        I recommend learning how to use this feature if your client has it. Otherwise, you'll
        have to carefully paste in only about 6-10 lines at a time.
