=== THE GOLEM
{yPowerful {<{ra{Dr{wom{Da{rs{> practically billow in a vortex out of the steam-powered door
{yof this establishment the moment anyone steps on one of the {<{Dpressure plates{>
{yto open it. Some races may find themselves more sensitive to the explosion of
{yscents than others - a powerful smell of {<{Dsp{ric{Des{> is the most noticeable above
{ystrong notes of different kinds of meat being cooked, primarily {<{rbacon{>, {<{Dbeef{>
{yand chicken. Other savory scents waft from the numerous kitchen devices being
{ytended by a massive, animated {<{rco{Dntrapti{ron{> that dominates the entire back wall
{yof the establishment. Spits, ovens, racks, stoves and even a cleverly
{yengineered {<{cdrink{> serving station, arranged in a way that almost seems to
{yenvelop the bar area in a {<{Dme{wch{Wan{wic{Dal{> embrace, all churn and {<{wst{We{wam{> away as the
{ymany dark appendages of the huge golem operate dials, levers and bellows.
{x
{yThe bar stretches across the width of the room just in front of the looming
{ygolem, hosting plenty of barstools. The lighting in the place is dim, even
{yedgy, with the constant, rhythmic {<{wchu{Drn{wing{> of the machines providing a sort
{yof continuous percussion. With the golem's ceaseless, aggressive operation,
{yit's like there's a darkly {<{Dcl{yockwo{Drk{>-themed party forever going on even when
{yno one else is here.{x
