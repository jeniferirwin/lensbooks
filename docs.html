    <h2>BASICS</h2>
    <p>
      To use the generator, start putting text in the left box. In the
      right box, you'll see a WYSIWYG version of your future book.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the box at the very bottom, you'll find all the commands required to
      create the book in-game. You can copy these and then paste them into the
      MUD to string up your entire book at once! Please read the Caveats section
      below before doing this, however.
    </p>
    <h2>CONFIGURATION</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">KEYWORD</span> is 'book' by default. This is the keyword that will be used
        in the restring commands.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">MAX COLUMNS</span> is 78 by default. It is not recommended to change this, but it's
        there if your book has unusual formatting requirements.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">MAX LINES</span> is 24 by default. Setting this to 120 will disable automatic page breaking.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        The 78x24 defaults ensure that your book's pages will fit in almost any
        screen configuration without having to scroll.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        Your text will be automatically broken into pages that
        conform to the columns and lines specified.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        If you find 24 to be too cramped, 50 lines is probably
        reasonable for most computer screens.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ANATOMY OF A BOOK</h2>
    <h3>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h3>
    <p>
      The table of contents is usually a bit of a drag to make by hand, but it's also an incredibly
      important part of a book. Fortunately, the generator will create the table of contents
      for you automatically!
    </p>
    <p>
      You do need to help it do this, just a little bit. You do this by defining <span class="keyword">CHAPTERS</span>
      in your book.
    </p>
    <h3>CHAPTERS</h3>
    <p>
      A CHAPTER of a book is a group of related pages. The Table of Contents will indicate
      how many pages are in a chapter, like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
    The Early Years ................... 01-09
    Before the War .................... 10-15
    Conflict .......................... 15-21
    Aftermath ......................... 22-25
    </pre>
    <p>
      The beauty of the generator is that the pages will be automatically broken up,
      identified and numbered for you. All you have to do is provide the chapter
      names and provide any forced page breaks where desired.
    </p>
    <h3>PAGES</h3>
    <p>
      Each page has the page number and chapter name up at the top. The bottom line
      of a page shows the commands to get to adjacent pages. The body of the page shows
      whatever text you've written.
    </p>
    <h2>MARKDOWN</h2>
    <ul>
    <li class="spaced">To start a new chapter, place three equals signs and then the chapter name:<br><code>=== The Early Years</code></li>
    <li class="spaced">To force a page break, place three asterisks on a line by themselves:<br><code>***</code></li>
    <li class="spaced">To create a blank line, use <code>{x</code>, or some other color code:<br><code>{x</code></li>
    <li class="spaced">
      When making chapters and page breaks, the line MUST start with the equals signs or asterisks.
      If there is a space, color code or anything else before the symbols, it will be interpreted
      as part of the book. There may be situations where you want to do this. Note that chapter names
      can have color codes in them - just make sure the line starts with the three equals signs!
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>CAVEATS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="spaced">
        You need to make sure that you DON'T paste all the commands into
        the MUD at once, or you WILL be disconnected!
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        Some MUD clients have a feature that
        allows you to load in a text file as a series of commands, with a short delay between each line.
        I recommend learning how to use this feature if your client has it. Otherwise, you'll
        have to carefully paste in only about 6-10 lines at a time. 
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        Double and triple-check to make sure the keyword is correct! It's best if you have
        already done the basic keyword/short/long restringing or detailing on your book.
        You could put a super unique keyword in there, like 'mattsbookofmachines', to be
        certain that you won't be accidentally stringing something else in your inventory.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        Another strategy to avoid messing up items is to just make sure that the only things
        you're carrying are the restring tokens and the book you want to string.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        Testing has shown that the maximum number of lines in a buffer is 120. Trying to set
        MAX LINES above this may have strange consequences.
      </li>
