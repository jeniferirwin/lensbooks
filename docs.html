    <h2>BASICS</h2>
    <p>
      To use the generator, fill out the configuration fields and then start putting text in the INPUT box.
      In the WYSYWIG box below, you'll start to see a preview of your book.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third box at the very bottom, you'll find all the commands required to
      create the book in-game. You can copy these and then paste them into the
      MUD to string up your entire book at once! Please read the Caveats section
      below before doing this, however.
    </p>
    <h2>CONFIGURATION</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">KEYWORD</span> is 'book' by default. This is the keyword that will be used
        in the restring commands.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">TITLE</span> is 'Title' by default. This is the title of your book, and
        will be displayed on the table of contents.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">AUTHOR</span> is 'Author' by default. This is the author of your book, and
        will be displayed on the table of contents.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">TAGLINE</span> is blank by default. This is an optional little blurb that
        will be displayed below the title and author name on the table of contents.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">DEFAULT COLOR</span> is {x by default. This is the color code that will
          be used as the default color for all of the text in your book. The generator places this color
          code at the beginning of every line. While you can use whatever Lensmoor color code you like,
          keep in mind that it can be unpleasant to read large blocks of bright, garish text. {x, {g, and {c are
          commonly used, safe choices.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">UI COLOR</span> is the color used for the headers, footers and other
        decorations in the book.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">MAX COLUMNS</span> is 77 by default. 
        Values higher than 77 will irritate the in-game
        editor (and probably most readers). It won't go lower than 5 or higher than 502.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span class="keyword">MAX ROWS</span> is 24 by default. It won't go lower than 5 or higher than 120.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        The 77x24 defaults ensure that your book's pages will fit in almost any
        screen configuration without having to scroll.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        If you find 24 to be too cramped, 50 lines is probably
        reasonable for most computer screens.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>ANATOMY OF A BOOK</h2>
    <h3>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h3>
      <p>The table of contents will have the keyword of 'contents'. To help your reader
      find it, you should indicate somewhere in the main description of your book that the reader
      needs to type: <code class="command">read contents</code>
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example of what that might look like.</p>
    <div class="example-main-desc">
      <p>
      This is a thick book bound in dark brown leather. The binding and pages are made of
      smooth, high quality materials. The title is proudly
      embossed in gold lettering on the front: <span class="gold">TRIUMPH ON THE COAST</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        To read the table of contents, type: <span class="command">read contents</span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The table of contents is usually a bit of a drag to make by hand, but it's also an incredibly
      important part of a book. Fortunately, the generator will create the table of contents
      for you automatically!
    </p>
      The Table of Contents will indicate
      how many pages are in a chapter, like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
    The Early Years ................... 01-09
    Before the War .................... 10-15
    Conflict .......................... 16-21
    Aftermath ......................... 22-25
    </pre>
    <p>
      You facilitate this by defining chapters
      in your book, using markdown as indicated below.</p>
    <h3>PAGES</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li class="spaced">
          The top line of a page is auto-generated. It shows the page number and the name of the chapter
          the page is in.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced">
          The bottom line
      of a page is auto-generated. It shows the commands to get to adjacent pages. It also shows the
      command to get back to the table of contents.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced">
          The body of the page shows
          whatever text you've written for it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>MARKDOWN</h2>
    <p>
      There are really only two pieces of markdown you need to know to make a book.
      These, along with any colors you want to use, will let you create clean, standardized
      books using the generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the use of LML is NOT supported with the generator. You CAN have LML in a book
      that you made here, but you need to edit the generated commands to make sure all required
      tags are in the right place.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li class="spaced">To start a new chapter, place three equals signs and then the chapter name:<br><code>=== The Early Years</code></li>
    <li class="spaced">To force a page break, place three asterisks on a line by themselves:<br><code>***</code></li>
    <li class="spaced">
      When making chapters and page breaks, the line MUST start with the equals signs or asterisks.
      If there is a space, color code or anything else before the symbols, it will be interpreted
      as part of a page body. There may be situations where this is desired. Note that chapter names
      can have color codes in them - just make sure the line starts with the three equals signs!
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>CAVEATS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="spaced">
        <span id="warn">No data gets saved on this site!</span> Keep your book in a text file and copy-paste it into the
        box. A quick way to clear the box is to put your cursor in it, press CTRL+A (select all) and then backspace. Then
        you can paste updated text in. Make sure you don't accidentally paste your book more than
        once, or you might waste restring tokens!
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        You need to make sure that you DON'T paste all the commands into
        the MUD at once, or you WILL be disconnected!
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        Some MUD clients have a feature that
        allows you to load in a text file as a series of commands, with a short delay between each line.
        I recommend learning how to use this feature if your client has it. Otherwise, you'll
        have to carefully paste in only about 6-10 lines at a time. 
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        Double and triple-check to make sure the keyword is correct! It's best if you have
        already done the basic keyword/short/long restringing or detailing on your book.
        You could put a super unique keyword in there, like 'mattsbookofmachines', to be
        certain that you won't be accidentally stringing something else in your inventory.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        Another strategy to avoid messing up items is to just make sure that the only things
        you're carrying are the restring tokens and the book you want to string.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        Testing has shown that the maximum number of lines in the in-game editor is 120. Trying to set
        MAX LINES above this may result in incomplete pages.
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">
        This generator does do a bit of very basic sanity checking, but it's not strenuous. You're free
        to make books with weird dimensions, but try to keep your audience in mind. Not all screen sizes
        are alike. The default is 77x24 for a reason!
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">This is not intended as a foolproof way for
        anyone to just hemmorhage random text and get a complete book back - the user is expected to study
        examples and practice a bit to get the hang of it. Remember, any character with 20 or more RP gets
        free restrings. Those are ideal characters to practice and test with!
      </li>
      <li class="spaced">Please CAREFULLY REVIEW the list of commands before pasting them into
        the MUD. I will not be held responsible for any objects that are botched as a result of using
        this generator!
      </li>
